# GeoMLA

Tutorials showing how Machine Learning algorithms can be used for spatial predictions (including spatiotemporal predictions). "Geo" stands for Geographical information and "MLA" for Machine Learning Algorithms. The author has also co-ordinased an international workshop [GeoMLA Belgrade in 2016](http://geomla.grf.bg.ac.rs/).
